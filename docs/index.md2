					Functions Galore!

Introduction

In this assignment we got to explore and play with a few different functions, 
and create one user defined function.

SQL UDF

User Defined Functions (UDF) are used when you need to create something tailored to your end users. 
For example, if you want to perform a calculation on data, you can create a user defined function to 
run the calculation on the selected data and return the results to the user in a simplified version, 
versus the user trying to truck through all the different functions and code to yield the same results.

Scalar, Inline, Multi-Statement Functions OH MY!

Scalar functions take multiple pieces of data or parameters to return a single value. The inline function 
is handy because it can help reduce the number of times you have to rewrite your code by simplifying things.
It allows you to group multiple statements together. Multi-statement function sounds like it would be the 
same however it is a table focused function. With the multi-statement function you can execute multiple queries, 
and then combine those results into a table, thus condensing the data into a single result.

Summary

Dare I say I had a little fun with this one. I think I finally learned with this assignment what a misplaced 
parentheses can do to your code. Must give special credit to my husband who found my extra parentheses after 
I spent 30 mins trying to figure out why my code wasnâ€™t running. It also gave me a different perspective on layout.
I see a couple of classmates have beautiful linear layouts and I like the look, but I felt it took up too much space, 
but after my parentheses fiasco I can appreciate how much easier it would have been to find if my code was better 
spaced and more linear.
